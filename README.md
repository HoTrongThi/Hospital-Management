## Technology Details

### HTML
HTML is integrated into JSP. It provides a means to structure text-based information in a document. It allows users to produce web pages that include text, graphics, and hyperlinks.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that supports the development of both client and server applications. It is preferred on the client side to write programs that can be executed by a web browser within the context of a web page.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document.

### SQL
SQL is the language used to manipulate relational databases. It is tied closely to the relational model and is used for data definition and data manipulation.

### Java Server Pages (JSP)
JSP is a simple yet powerful technology for creating and maintaining dynamic-content web pages. It is based on the Java programming language and can be thought of as an extension to servlets. JSP provides more functionality than servlets. A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags, making it easier to maintain since designing and development are separated.
